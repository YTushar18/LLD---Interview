Absolutely! Here‚Äôs a detailed summary of the SOLID principles, design patterns, and core components used in your Shopping Cart System:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ SOLID Principles

1. S ‚Äì Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Each class should have one responsibility.

Class	Responsibility
Item	Holds data about a single product.
CartItem	Associates an Item with a quantity.
Cart	Manages cart operations (add/remove items, observe stock updates).
Inventory	Manages stock levels and notifies observers.
PricingEngine	Calculates total price, applies discounts, handles sales.
Discount	Represents a single discount strategy.

Each class does only one thing and does it well, making the code maintainable and testable.

‚∏ª

2. O ‚Äì Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

‚úÖ Implemented via:
	‚Ä¢	DiscountType allows adding new discount types (e.g., BUY1GET1) without modifying PricingEngine.
	‚Ä¢	PricingEngine is designed to extend discount logic without altering existing code.
	‚Ä¢	Cart implements the StockObserver interface so that more observers (like notification service, dashboard, etc.) can be added later.

‚∏ª

3. L ‚Äì Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

Derived types must be substitutable for their base types.

‚úÖ Followed via:
	‚Ä¢	Cart can be treated as a StockObserver without breaking anything (thanks to abstraction).
	‚Ä¢	All observers adhere to the same notify() method signature defined in StockObserver.

‚∏ª

4. I ‚Äì Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

‚úÖ Achieved by:
	‚Ä¢	StockObserver interface has just one method: notify(). It doesn‚Äôt force implementing classes to implement irrelevant methods.

‚∏ª

5. D ‚Äì Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

‚úÖ Used via:
	‚Ä¢	Cart depends on the StockObserver abstraction rather than any concrete implementation.
	‚Ä¢	Inventory knows only about the StockObserver interface, not about Cart specifically ‚Äî making it extensible.

üß© Design Patterns Used

Observer Pattern
	‚Ä¢	Where: Inventory ‚Üî Cart
	‚Ä¢	Inventory maintains a list of StockObservers and notifies them on stock changes.
	‚Ä¢	Cart implements the StockObserver interface to stay updated about item stock.

‚∏ª

Strategy Pattern (Partial)
	‚Ä¢	Where: PricingEngine + Discount
	‚Ä¢	PricingEngine applies different pricing strategies based on DiscountType (FLAT or PERCENTAGE).
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs a soft form of Strategy pattern. To fully implement it, each strategy would be a separate class.

‚∏ª

üß± Components & Responsibilities

Component	Description
Item	Represents a product in catalog (id, name, price).
CartItem	A wrapper for an Item with a specific quantity.
Cart	Manages a collection of items; reacts to stock updates.
Inventory	Tracks stock levels and notifies observers on changes.
StockObserver	Interface for any component that wants inventory updates.
Discount	Represents a pricing rule (flat or percentage off).
PricingEngine	Calculates total cost using discounts and sales logic.

üõç Features Enabled by This Design
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Reusable across multiple UIs (CLI, Flask API, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Easy to plug in new pricing strategies, new observers, stock alerts, etc.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Can be extended to add coupon codes, checkout module, or user accounts without breaking existing logic.
