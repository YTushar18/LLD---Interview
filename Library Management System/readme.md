‚úÖ Overview of the Library Management System (LMS)

A Library Management System handles:
	‚Ä¢	Book inventory (add/remove/search)
	‚Ä¢	Users (members and admins)
	‚Ä¢	Borrowing and returning books
	‚Ä¢	Penalty for overdue
	‚Ä¢	Notifications
	‚Ä¢	Reports

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Step-by-Step Learning Plan

Step	Focus	Concepts & Patterns
1.	Basic Entities & Relationships	OOP, SOLID, Encapsulation
2.	Book Search, Borrow, Return	Command Pattern, Strategy
3.	Penalty Calculation	Strategy Pattern
4.	Notification System	Observer Pattern
5.	Role-based Access	Interface Segregation, Factory Pattern
6.	Extensibility: Reports, Inventory Alerts	Open/Closed, Decorator/Template Method


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Key Entities (OOP Classes)

Class	Description
Book	Represents a book with metadata and status
User	Base class for Member and Admin
Library	Manages catalog, users, and operations
Transaction	Tracks borrow/return logs
PenaltyCalculator	Abstracts how overdue fines are calculated
Notifier	Sends messages to users


‚∏ª

‚úÖ SOLID Principles Applied

Principle	Where It‚Äôs Applied
Single Responsibility	Book only holds book data, PenaltyCalculator only calculates fines
Open/Closed	New penalty logic can be added without changing existing code
Liskov Substitution	EmailNotifier and SMSNotifier inherit from Notifier
Interface Segregation	Admin and Member have their own clean interfaces
Dependency Inversion	Library uses Notifier abstraction, not concrete class


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Design Patterns Used

Pattern	Where
Strategy	Different PenaltyCalculator strategies
Observer	Notification system for due books
Factory	To create User or Notifier based on type
Template Method (optional)	For generating reports or processing returns
Command Pattern (optional)	To encapsulate operations like Borrow, Return


‚∏ª

‚úÖ Sample Component Summary

‚úÖ Book class

class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, isbn):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.isbn = isbn
        self.is_available = True

üü° Pattern: Basic OOP
‚úÖ SRP: Only manages book details

‚∏ª

‚úÖ PenaltyCalculator (Strategy Pattern)

class PenaltyCalculator(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_penalty(self, days_overdue: int) -> float:
        pass

class SimplePenalty(PenaltyCalculator):
    def calculate_penalty(self, days_overdue: int) -> float:
        return 1.0 * days_overdue

üü£ Pattern: Strategy
‚úÖ OCP: Add new calculation types without modifying this one

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Notifier (Observer Pattern)

class Notifier(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send(self, user, message): pass

class EmailNotifier(Notifier):
    def send(self, user, message):
        print(f"Email to {user.email}: {message}")

üîµ Pattern: Observer
‚úÖ LSP & DIP: EmailNotifier replaces Notifier cleanly

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Library (Manager Class)

class Library:
    def __init__(self):
        self.catalog = {}
        self.members = []

    def add_book(self, book): ...
    def borrow_book(self, user, book): ...
    def return_book(self, user, book): ...

üìò Pattern: Facade (optional)
‚úÖ SRP: Only manages coordination of actions

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Sample Use Case: Borrowing Flow
	1.	Member searches a book
	2.	Library checks availability
	3.	If available, create a Transaction
	4.	Book marked unavailable
	5.	Send Notification to member
	6.	Use PenaltyCalculator if returned late

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Extensibility Options

Feature	Strategy
Add Fine Cap	Decorator or Extended Strategy
Add Push Notifications	Add new Notifier subclass
Generate Daily Report	Template method for consistent structure
External API for book data	Adapter pattern
Schedule auto-notifications	Use Observer or Scheduler queue

‚úÖ Interview Tips

üìå Do‚Äôs:
	‚Ä¢	Always draw class diagram
	‚Ä¢	Talk about SOLID principles
	‚Ä¢	Mention patterns even if not asked
	‚Ä¢	Show how code is extensible

‚ùå Don‚Äôts:
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt dump everything in one class
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt mix user logic and system logic
	‚Ä¢	Don‚Äôt forget error handling (e.g., borrow unavailable book)



‚úÖ Applied SOLID Principles

Principle	Where It‚Äôs Applied	Explanation
Single Responsibility	Book, Transaction, Notifier, PenaltyCalculator	Each class handles one responsibility: Book info, transaction tracking, notification, or penalty logic.
Open/Closed	PenaltyCalculator, Notifier	You can add new penalty or notification strategies without modifying existing code.
Liskov Substitution	Admin, Member inherit User	Subclasses can replace the base class without breaking functionality.
Interface Segregation	Notifier & Penalty are well-segregated	Users of Library only interact with relevant interfaces.
Dependency Inversion	Library depends on abstract Notifier, PenaltyCalculator	Promotes flexibility via strategy pattern.


‚∏ª

üß± Design Patterns Used

Pattern	Component	Purpose
Strategy	PenaltyCalculator, Notifier	Switch behavior (e.g., different penalty or notification types).
Observer (via simulation)	EmailNotifier.send()	Notifies users on events (borrow, return).
Factory (implicit)	Can be added for creating Users or Books	Useful if we want object creation logic to scale.
Repository (optional)	Library.catalog and transactions	Acts like an in-memory data store for books and borrowing events.


‚∏ª

üß© Key Components Summary
	‚Ä¢	Book: Simple data model for library books.
	‚Ä¢	User: Abstract base class. Member and Admin extend it.
	‚Ä¢	PenaltyCalculator: Strategy pattern for overdue fee logic.
	‚Ä¢	Notifier: Strategy pattern for alerting users (via email now).
	‚Ä¢	Transaction: Tracks when a user borrows and returns a book.
	‚Ä¢	Library: The main orchestrator managing books, users, and transactions.
